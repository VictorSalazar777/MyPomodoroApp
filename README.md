# MyPomodoroApp

App that shows a Pomodoro counter, 15 min or 20 min. I haven't 
added a break time counter yet. The UI is very basic, I will improve
it in a future version.

I used:

* Android framework.
* Java.
* Audio.
* TDD.
* Mockito.
* ViewModel (MVVM).
* Activity.
* Service.
* Broadcast receiver.
* Shared preferences.
* Material components.
